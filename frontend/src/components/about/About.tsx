                    <p>Artist, author, meditator, yogini, traveler, beloved, and grateful mother of two boys. If you've made it this far, you probably know what I'm passionate about...creating content that illuminates the heart and unifies humanity!</p>

                    <p>Art is my medicine, my muse. I love painting, mosaics, poetry, and many other forms of expression.</p>

                    <p>The World of We Are One books, app, and show have been inspired by motherhood. With the gift of children, I experienced the pristine clarity of unified consciousness. Witnessing their natural state of being and highly adaptive minds highlighted the importance of surrounding them with holistic content; resulting in the books We Are One & We Are Love.</p>

                    <p>Over the years, as the books and cards traveled the world collecting awards, I received countless letters of gratitude from children, parents, grandparents, carers, teachers, etc. This sparked and greatly influenced a longing to share these messages on a broader platform.</p>

                    <p>Then, a few years ago, hands in the dirt, I had a vision to bring the World of We Are One alive on screen! Excited though inexperienced, began making dolls & puppets of characters from the books and following the creative thread of set/costume design, animation, screenwriting, filming, and app development.</p>


                    <p>Itâ€™s been inspiring...and, well, talk about steep learning curves! Whew!</p>

                    <p>The journey into the unknown is like that though...</p>
                    <p>So, I just keep taking the next step...</p>
                    <p>With love, it can only lead to a life full of miracles!</p>
                    <p>May yours lead there too!</p>
