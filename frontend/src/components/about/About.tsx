                    <p>Artist, author, meditator, yogini, traveler, beloved, and grateful mother of two boys. If you've made it this far, you probably know what I'm passionate about...creating content that inspires the heart and unifies humanity!</p>

                    <p>Art is my medicine, my muse. I love creating, painting, mosaics, poetry, and many other forms of expression.</p>

                    <p>The creation of the books, App, and show have been inspired by motherhood. During the first year of Zade’s life, his unified consciousness was crystal clear. His natural state of being and highly adaptive mind made me acutely aware of the responsibility to surround him with content that reflected unity & love, inspiring the book, We Are One.</p>

     
                    <p>My second son Jiah was born two years later, blessing life and flooding our hearts with even more love! Our family blossomed, paving the way for the second book, We Are Love.</p>

                    <p>Over the years, the books and cards have traveled the world collecting awards along the way. As they did, a longing to share these messages on a broader platform has grown from strength to strength.</p>

                    <p>As a result, three years ago, hands in the dirt, a vision to bring the World of We Are One alive on screen dawned! So began the building of sets, costume design, sewing dolls & puppets, animating, screenwriting, videography, and App development.</p>

                    <p>It’s been inspiring...and, well, talk about steep learning curves! Whew!</p>
                    <p>The journey into the unknown is like that, so...</p>
                    <p>I take the next step...</p>
                    <p>With love, it can only lead to a life full of miracles!</p>
                    <p>May yours lead there too!</p>
                    <p className="text-font-color-blue">Many blessings, Jennifer</p>
