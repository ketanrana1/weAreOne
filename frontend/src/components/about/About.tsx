                <p>Thank you for visiting the World of We Are One website! I am grateful for every visit and each moment we contemplate, integrate, and accept being a member of our global community. Through our awareness and recognition, we relate to all beings and life forms collectively to nurture and cultivate the love that we are. This knowing is inherent in us when we are born, though at our human evolutionary point, humans, and therefore society, do not often reflect our true essence, and the illusion of separation continues. This is the root of great suffering which affects us consciously and unconsciously. By bringing awareness within, through inquiry and deep contemplation, these illusions begin to dissolve.</p>
                <p>My vision and motivation to reflect our unified existence has led to the creation of two children's books, We Are One and We Are Love, accompanied by the Exploration Cards. These books are anchor points to remind us of our divine essence.  Let's support and guide our young children into a new paradigm, one that celebrates life in all of its diversity!</p>
                <p>The following are some detailed events that have shaped my life, if you choose to complete your reading now...</p>
                <h2>Thank You for visiting, Jennifer</h2>
                <p>I was born in Buffalo, New York in 1967, at 2 years of age my mom, younger brother, and I moved to West Palm Beach, Florida. We lived in a trailer while mom worked 2 jobs to support us. When I was 5 she met my dad, (bringing a new sister), they married and birthed 3 brothers. </p>
                <p>When 15, my family moved to the Gold Coast, Queensland Australia with the promise of a simpler drug-free environment for our upbringing. This was a smart though uncomfortable move at my age and did prove successful. I left high school at the end of year 11 to pursue an apprenticeship in hairdressing, worked for a great company, established good work ethics, developed socially, and began exploring creatively.</p>
                <p>In my early 20's I took a trip to the United States, bought an old milk van (which had been converted into a mobile home), and traveled across the country for a couple of years. While falling in the love with the incredible varied beauty of the landscape, I also experienced the diverse cultures and societal conditions, some of which were disturbing and dangerous.</p>

            <div className="btm-cont">
                <p>Looking back, I can see that my return to Australia was influenced by an illusion that I could hide and avoid facing the harsh inequalities, prejudices, and racism I witnessed while traveling through the cities and towns of my homeland. This worked for a while as I explored my creativity through ceramics, opened a business, and happily painted away. My first impulses towards healing and awakening also surfaced at that time, offering hope and evolution.</p>
                <p>Years rolled by as I practiced the art of mosaics, painting, poetry, spirit, and love. My joy of travel continued and led me to Mexico, Guatemala, Israel, Egypt, and India, eventually settling in the coastal town of Byron Bay, Australia. This beautiful environment was full of healers, mystics, artists, musicians, and eclectic dreamers, which supported my spiritual practice through Vipassana Meditation, circle work, dance, and A Course in Miracles.</p>
                <p>In 2003, while living the dream on the beach in a communal environment, a fire claimed my home and studio. For months prior I had experienced signs and intuitive impulses to relocate (which I did not acknowledge), in the end, the power of nature did it for me. A deeply transformational time, resulting in the dissolution of an attachment to my identity as an artist, an embodied awareness of the beauty and freedom of impermanence, and glaringly obvious...the power of intuition!</p>
                <p>Within a year I was living on a magical land full of communal garden dreams, playing, dancing, and creating. Filled with life's earthly treasures, my spirit still stirred restlessly, so I decided to participate in the Path of Love workshop. This journey not only offered a profound deepening within me, I also met my beloved, Steve.  A corporate lawyer living in Sydney, it was not long before he joined me in the Byron shire. Our union gifted the birth of our first son Zade, showering our lives with miracles and inspiring the creation of the book We Are One. Followed by the blessing of our son Jiah, who flooded our hearts with profound love, resulting in the creation of the book We Are Love.</p>
                <p>Once in print, We Are One, We Are Love, and the accompanying Exploration Cards won Gold in the Mom's Choice Awards, We Are Love was awarded the Seal of Excellence in the Creative Child Awards, and the We Are One Exploration Cards was awarded a Preferred Choice Award in Creative Child Awards. As the publishing industry continued its adjustments to the technological age, I decided to come out of the studio to share the books with the world, this eventuated in our move to Sydney, Australia.</p>
                <p>In 2012, Steve was offered a contract in Mongolia as a Leadership Consultant, and we spent the following two years living in Ulaanbaatar. From here we traveled to Hong Kong, Thailand, England, France, and Turkey.  After our time in Mongolia, we spent a year living in San Fransico, California, and then returned home to our treasured home of Byron Bay, Australia in 2016. </p>
                <p>Many Blessings and once again...Thank you for visiting, Jennifer</p>
